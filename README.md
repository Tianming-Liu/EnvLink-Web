## EnvLink-Web

EnvLink-Web hosts the public-facing frontend of the EnvLink project. It stitches together Potree with Mapbox + Cesium scenes so users can explore **heritage habitats** in 2D and 3D, together with sensor timelines.

- `index.html` bootstraps the landing page
- `viz_html/envlink.html` loads the immersive viewer
